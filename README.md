# 28 Frames Later 

![Gameplay in Egypt](./data/assets/28-frames-later.png)

Currently in active development phase, hoping to have a playable crossplatform demo before thanksgiving.
To play the game just git clone or download the repository then execute the binary (a.out) or compile for your platform of choice.
I only plan to support mouse and keyboard peripherals but SDL2 can support controlers/joy sticks/etc. so feel free to diy :)

Luke 22:36-38
Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.
And he said unto them, It is enough.

"even the best weapon
is an unhappy tool,
hateful to living things."
-Lao Tzu (translated by Ursula K. Le Guin)
