# 28 Frames Later 

![Gameplay in Egypt](./data/assets/28-frames-later.png)

Gameplay consists of trying to kill zombies and survive while collecting loot like ammo and health.

To play the game just git clone or download the repository then execute the binary (a.out) or compile for your platform of choice.
I only plan to support mouse and keyboard peripherals but SDL2 can support controlers/joy sticks/etc. so feel free to diy :)
